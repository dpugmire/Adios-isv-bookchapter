The Adaptable I/O System (ADIOS) provides a publish/subscribe abstraction for data access and storage.
The framework provides various engines for producing and consuming data through different mediums (storage, memory, network) for various application scenarios.
ADIOS engines exist to write/read files on a storage system, to couple independent simulations together or to stream data from a simulation to analysis and visualization tools via the computer's network infrastructure, and to stream experimental/observational data from the producer to data processors via the wide-area-network.
Both lossy and lossless compression are supported by ADIOS to provide for seamless exchange of data between producer and consumer.
In this work we provide a description for the ADIOS framework and the abstractions provided.
We demonstrate the capabilities of the ADIOS framework using a number of examples, including strong coupling of simulation codes, in situ visualization running on a separate computing cluster, and streaming of experimental data between Asia and the United States.
