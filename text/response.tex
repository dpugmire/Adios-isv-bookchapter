\section{Response to Reviewer Comments}

We express our appreciation to the reviewers for the time they took to carefully read this chapter and provide their thoughts and suggestions on how to improve this chapter.  We have addressed the reviewers comments with the following changes.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The introduction was re-written to provide a higher level framing for the ADIOS system. References were made back to the Introduction chapter to match the terminology used. A figure was added that provides a high level view for how ADIOS can be used for in situ visualization. The structure of section 1 was also modified so that some of the lower level details were only introduced after the high level discussion and tiebacks to Chapter 1 of the book.
    \item The taxonomy from Chapter 1 was referenced and the relationship of ADIOS to these were described.
    \item The tables in section 3 were modified to increase readability.
    \item We removed some details to particular codes in section 1 that were not needed and merely complicated the text for people not familar with ADIOS.
    \item The code listings were simplified. Listings 3 and 4 were replaced with references back to Listings 1 and 2 with directions for what line to change.
    \item We addressed the typo and grammar issues that were noted.
    \item We made several editing passes to improve flow and improve readability.
\end{itemize}
