We perform an application study in collaboration with fusion simulation scientists on data sets up to 489 GB per time step. We consider multiple ways to carry out the binning, and determine which techniques work the best for this simulation. With the best techniques we demonstrate reduction factors as large as 109x with low error percentage.",

abstractNote = {The Adaptable I/O System (ADIOS) represents the culmination of substantial investment in Scientific Data Management, and it has demonstrated success for several important extreme-scale science cases. However, looking towards the exascale and beyond, we see the development of yet more stringent data management requirements that require new abstractions. Therefore, there is an opportunity to attempt to connect the traditional realms of HPC I/O optimization with the Database / Data Management community. As such, in this paper we offer some specific examples from our ongoing work in managing data structures, services, and performance at the extreme scale for scientific computing. Using the publish/subscribe model afforded by ADIOS, we demonstrate a set of services that connect data format, metadata, queries, data reduction, and high-performance delivery. The resulting publish/subscribe framework facilitates connection to on-line workflow systems to enable the dynamic capabilities that will be required for exascale science.},
